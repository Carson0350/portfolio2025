# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

**Desired outcomes this PRD will deliver:**

- Launch a professional portfolio website that showcases Carson Antoine's full-stack engineering expertise to technical hiring managers and recruiters
- Demonstrate technical excellence through implementation quality (Lighthouse 95+, WCAG AA compliance, optimal Core Web Vitals)
- Communicate Carson's unique career transition story (healthcare → software engineering) in a compelling, memorable way
- Provide a centralized platform to showcase 3-5 detailed project case studies with measurable business impact
- Establish an online presence that increases interview conversion rate by 30% within 3 months
- Generate 5+ inbound recruiter contacts per month through organic discovery and SEO optimization
- Create a maintainable, scalable foundation that can evolve into a personal brand platform (blog, content, community)
- Deliver a fully responsive, accessible, performant web application within 2-3 weeks

## Background Context

Carson Antoine is a senior full-stack software engineer with 5+ years of experience specializing in .NET/C#, React, and Azure cloud-native development. He successfully transitioned from healthcare to software engineering via Hack Reactor bootcamp in 2020 and has since delivered significant impact across healthcare, insurance, and consulting domains—including a notable 40% workflow optimization achievement. Despite his strong technical background and measurable accomplishments, Carson currently lacks a professional online presence beyond LinkedIn and a static resume, creating a credibility gap with hiring managers who increasingly prioritize portfolio reviews in their evaluation process.

The portfolio website will serve dual purposes: it showcases Carson's work while simultaneously demonstrating his technical capabilities through the quality of its implementation. By building a performance-optimized, accessible, modern web application using Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, the portfolio itself becomes a case study in senior-level engineering practices. This approach directly addresses the differentiation challenge in a competitive job market and provides tangible proof of Carson's claimed expertise in modern development practices, including AI-assisted development tools like Windsurf and Cursor.
