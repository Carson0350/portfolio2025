## Priority Legend

- **P0 (Critical):** Must have for MVP, blocks other work
- **P1 (High):** Core functionality, high user value
- **P2 (Medium):** Important but can be deferred if needed
- **P3 (Low):** Nice to have, post-MVP

---

## Dependencies & Sequencing

**Critical Path:**

1. Epic 1 (Foundation) → Blocks all other work
2. Epic 2 (UI Framework) → Blocks all sections
3. Epic 3 (Content) → Blocks sections 4-6
4. Epic 6 (Projects) → Core differentiator, high priority
5. Epic 9 (Testing & Launch) → Final gate before production

**Parallel Work Opportunities:**

- Epic 3 (Content creation) can happen alongside Epic 2 (UI work)
- Epic 8 (SEO/Performance) can be done incrementally throughout
- Story 4.3 (Headshot) can be sourced early in Sprint 1

---

## Risk Management

**High Risk Stories:**

- 7.5: Resend API integration (external dependency)
- 7.6: Rate limiting (Upstash Redis setup)
- 8.5: Core Web Vitals optimization (may require iteration)
- 9.1: Accessibility audit (may uncover issues requiring rework)

**Mitigation:**

- Test external APIs early (Sprint 1 if possible)
- Budget extra time for performance optimization
- Run accessibility checks throughout development, not just at end
