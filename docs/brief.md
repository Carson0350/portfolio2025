# Project Brief: Carson Antoine - Professional Portfolio Site

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** November 5, 2025  
**Project Type:** Personal Portfolio Website  
**Status:** Initial Brief

---

## Executive Summary

Carson Antoine's professional portfolio is a modern, performance-optimized web application designed to showcase his full-stack software engineering expertise to technical hiring managers and senior engineers at mid-to-large tech companies. The portfolio highlights his 5+ years of experience in .NET/C#, React, Azure, and cloud-native development, with a compelling narrative around his successful career transition from healthcare to software engineering. The site will demonstrate both technical depth and business impact, featuring measurable achievements (40% workflow optimization), diverse project experience across healthcare and fintech domains, and modern development practices using AI-assisted tools.

**Key Value Proposition:** A technically sophisticated portfolio that proves engineering excellence through implementation quality, not just project descriptions.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State

Carson is actively seeking senior/lead software engineering positions but lacks a centralized, professional online presence to showcase his technical capabilities and career achievements. His current professional profile exists only through:

- LinkedIn (limited technical depth)
- Resume (static, text-only format)
- No live code samples or project demonstrations
- No platform to tell his unique career transition story

### Pain Points

1. **Credibility Gap:** Without a portfolio, hiring managers cannot verify technical skills or see code quality
2. **Differentiation Challenge:** In a competitive market, Carson needs to stand out beyond resume keywords
3. **Story Telling:** His healthcare → software engineering transition is compelling but not effectively communicated
4. **Technical Proof:** Claims of "40% optimization" and "serverless architecture" need tangible demonstration
5. **Modern Stack Showcase:** Experience with cutting-edge tools (Windsurf, Cursor) isn't visible to recruiters

### Impact

- Missed opportunities with companies that prioritize portfolio reviews in hiring process
- Inability to demonstrate full-stack capabilities in a single, cohesive presentation
- Lost competitive advantage against candidates with strong online presence
- Reduced callback rates from technical recruiters and hiring managers

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- Generic portfolio templates don't showcase technical sophistication
- LinkedIn profiles lack depth for senior engineering roles
- GitHub alone doesn't provide context or narrative around projects
- Resume formats can't demonstrate interactive, live functionality

### Urgency

Carson is currently in active job search mode (last role ended October 2025). A professional portfolio is critical for:

- Immediate application to senior/lead positions
- Networking at tech events and conferences
- Inbound recruiter interest
- Personal brand establishment in the tech community

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

A **Next.js 14+ portfolio application** that serves as both a showcase of Carson's work AND a demonstration of his technical capabilities. The portfolio itself becomes a project that proves his expertise in:

- Modern React development (App Router, Server Components)
- TypeScript and type-safe development
- Performance optimization (Core Web Vitals)
- Responsive design and accessibility
- Cloud deployment (Vercel)

### Key Differentiators

1. **Technical Sophistication:** The portfolio's codebase demonstrates senior-level engineering practices
2. **Performance-First:** Lighthouse scores of 95+ across all metrics
3. **Interactive Elements:** Live demos, code playgrounds, or embedded projects
4. **Narrative-Driven:** Career transition story woven throughout the experience
5. **Content Strategy:** Technical blog posts demonstrating thought leadership
6. **Modern Stack:** Uses technologies Carson wants to work with (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind)

### Why This Will Succeed

- **Proof Through Implementation:** The portfolio itself is a technical case study
- **SEO Optimized:** Discoverable by recruiters searching for ".NET React developer" etc.
- **Shareable:** Single URL that can be included in all applications and communications
- **Maintainable:** Easy to update with new projects, blog posts, and achievements
- **Scalable:** Can grow into a personal brand platform (newsletter, courses, etc.)

### High-Level Vision

A clean, fast, accessible portfolio that immediately communicates technical excellence while providing depth for those who want to explore further. The site should feel like a product built by a senior engineer, not a template filled in by a junior developer.
