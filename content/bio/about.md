# From Healthcare to Code: My Journey

My path to software engineering is anything but traditional. After years in healthcare, I discovered my true calling in technology—a transition that has shaped my unique approach to problem-solving and user-centered development.

## The Transition

Working in healthcare taught me the critical importance of precision, empathy, and systems thinking. These skills proved invaluable when I made the leap into software engineering. I brought with me a deep understanding of how technology can genuinely improve people's lives, not just through features, but through thoughtful, accessible design.

## What I Do

Today, I'm a Full Stack Developer specializing in building modern, scalable web applications. I work primarily with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and **Next.js**, creating solutions that are both technically robust and delightfully user-friendly.

My approach combines technical excellence with real-world impact. I don't just write code—I build experiences that solve actual problems for real people.

## Notable Achievements

- **Performance Optimization**: Improved application performance by 40% through strategic code optimization and architectural improvements
- **Quality & Reliability**: Reduced bug count significantly by implementing comprehensive testing strategies and CI/CD pipelines
- **User Experience**: Enhanced user satisfaction through thoughtful UI/UX improvements and accessibility compliance
- **Team Leadership**: Mentored junior developers on best practices, code review, and professional growth

## My Philosophy

I believe in writing code that is:

- **Clean and Maintainable**: Future developers (including future me) should understand it easily
- **User-Focused**: Technology serves people, not the other way around
- **Continuously Improving**: There's always something new to learn and ways to grow

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not coding, I'm exploring the latest web technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community. My healthcare background reminds me daily that behind every user story is a real person with real needs—and that perspective drives everything I build.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in challenging projects, collaborative opportunities, and conversations about technology's role in making the world a bit better. Whether you're looking to build something new or improve something existing, I'd love to hear from you.
